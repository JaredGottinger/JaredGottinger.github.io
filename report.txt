REPORT BODY---------------------------------------------------

The password protection method I chose was to use a javascript prompt where the entered password would have to match a predefined hard-coded value. If the values match, you will be redirected to the content page. I also put it in a while loop so more than one attempt can be made to enter the password.

The new tag I tried was the <table> tag. While I do have past html experience, I hadn't needed to use the table tag at any point so this was my first time using it. As you'd expect, it allowed me to create a table. By adjusting the attributes, I was able to change the border size and header rows to make it more visually appealing.

I tried viewing this page on both firefox and chrome and it did appear slightly different. I noticed that the text appears slightly thicker on firefox than chrome.

I spent approximately 40 minutes on this lab between creating the website, finding a password protection method, and finding a way to host the website. This report took an additional 15 minutes to do.
